# Sample Code Sets for Bulk Processing

This folder contains ready-to-use sample files to exercise the bulk analysis and CSV export flows in Code Evaluator Unified.

## Scenario: Sum of Numbers

- Path: `samples/sum-of-numbers/`
- Problem: Code to print the sum of numbers from 1 to N
- Files provided (multi-language):
  - `sum.py`
  - `sum.js`
  - `Sum.java`
  - `sum.ts`
  - `sum.cpp`
  - `sum.c`
  - `sum.go`
  - `sum.rb`
- Problem statement: See `PROBLEM.md`

## How to Use

1. Open the web app (frontend) and switch to the Bulk Processing tab.
2. Click “Choose files” and select all files from `samples/sum-of-numbers/`.
3. Paste the problem statement from `PROBLEM.md` into the Problem Statement field.
4. Start the analysis. Once finished, you can:
   - View per-file results
   - Export CSV (Summary or Detailed)

## Tips

- You can mix and match subsets of files to test batch behavior.
- For CSV export, use “Detailed” to include most fields.
- If you need a larger batch, duplicate files or add variations.
