# Problem Statement

Code to print the sum of numbers.

Write a program that reads an integer N (from STDIN) and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to N.

- Input: integer N (e.g., `10`)
- Output: a single integer equal to `1 + 2 + ... + N`
- Constraints: Assume `N >= 0`
- Example:
  - Input: `10`
  - Output: `55`

Use these sample files for bulk processing and the CSV export feature. You can paste the following into the Problem Statement field before starting analysis:

> Write a program that reads an integer N and prints the sum 1+2+...+N. Include clear variable names, handle edge cases (N=0), and mention time complexity.
